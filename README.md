Package photobiology is a set of tools to be used together with packages photobiologyUV, photobiologyVIS, and photobiologyPhy for calculating derived quantities from spectral irradiance data. The derived quantities are used to quantify the effect of radiation on different organisms or processes within organisms. Photobiology is a package that provides the basic building blocks for the other more applied packages, but these tools can also be useful to normal users.

We have attamped to keep a good balance between fast computation, easy to maintain code, and a clear interface. 

This R package is a rewrite with a new user interface of the package UVcalc that started as companion to a handbook of methods in plant UV photobiology writen within the COST Action FA0906 UV4growth. The programing was done by P. J. Aphalo, but the information used was collected, discussed and evaluated in many cases by other contributors to the handbook.
