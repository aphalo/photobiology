Package photobiology is a set of tools to be used together with otehr packages in the r4photobiology suite of classes, methods, functions and data designed to facilitate photobiology related data analysis and simualtion.

We have attamped to keep a good balance between fast computation, easy to maintain code, and a clear interface. The package has in addition to user-friendly methods and objects, also functions optimized for raw performance.

This suite of R packages started a rewrite of the package UVcalc that was developed as a companion to a handbook of methods in plant UV photobiology writen within the COST Action FA0906 UV4growth. The programing was done by P. J. Aphalo, but the information used was collected, discussed and evaluated in many cases by other contributors to the handbook and also provided by researchers in academy and industry.
