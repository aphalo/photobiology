Dear Pedro,

thank you for your quick answer. Raman spikes are randomly distributed and not all the spectra show 
them. They are usually ~4/5 "pixel" wide.  
On Friday, I found an algorithm that does exactly what I was looking for 
https://chemrxiv.org/articles/A_Simple_Algorithm_for_Despiking_Raman_Spectra/5993011/2. I send 
you a part of my script and two spectra files to test it. Could it be maybe possible to implement the 
algorithm in your package?

Best regards,
Agnese
