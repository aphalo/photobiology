# photobiolgy #

Package '**photobiolgy**' defines a system of classes for storing spectral data
and accompanying metdata. For each of these classes specialised summary methods,
maths operators and functions are provided. In addition, classes for storing
collections of objects of the classes for individual spectra are defined as well
as 'apply' functions. Extraction and replacement operators are also implemented.

This package is the core of a suite of R packages for photobiological
calculations described at the [r4photobiology](http://www.r4photobiology.info)
web site.
