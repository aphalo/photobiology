  object,

  ...,
  expand = "none"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of one of the spectral classes for which a summary is
desired}

\item{maxsum}{integer Indicates how many levels should be shown for factors.}

\item{digits}{integer Used for number formatting with \code{\link{format}()}.}

\item{idx}{character Name of the column with the names of the members of the
collection of spectra.}

\item{which.metadata}{character vector Names of attributes to retrieve, or
"none" or "all". Obeyed if \code{expand = FALSE}, its default.}

\item{expand}{character One of "none", "collection" or "each"
indicating that multiple spectra in long form should be converted to a
collection of spectra in advance of summary, summarized as a collection or
individually.}

\item{...}{additional arguments affecting the summary produced, ignored in
current version}
}
\value{
A summary object matching the class of \code{object} or a list of
  summary objects, each matching the class of the corresponding member of
  of \code{object}.

A summary object matching the class of \code{object}, a list of
  such objects or a summary object for a matching collection of spectra.
