photobiology 0.2.5
==================

A vignette "Manual" was added.

photobiology 0.2.4
==================

As profiling showed that calls to insert_hinges() and within this function to which() were 
uisng most of run time of the functions, a new parameter was added to functions so that
the use of hinges can be switched on and off. The default is to use hinges for interpolation
only if the wavelength resolution of the spectrum is worse than 1.0 nm. This causes only
small errors in the results of calculations (< 1%) but reduces run time very significantly.
The defaults should work just fine in most cases, in which case there is no need to do any
changes to user code. In addition new_waveband() was modified so that if no SWF is used,
then hinges are not included in the waveband defined.

photobiology 0.2.2-0.2.3
========================

Revised photon_ratio() to use same optimizations.

Imporved implementation of cache. Now it is enclosed in an environment that is created when
the package is loaded and removed when it is unloaded.


photobiology 0.2.1
==================

Factored to a separate function the code to check spectral data, and added argument to irradiance to switch off the checking.

Added a "name" field to wavebands and a wb.name argument to new_waveband(), with a default so that no old code will be broken.

Added argument to calc_multipliers() to enable caching. Disabled by default.

Added argument to irradiance() to enable/disable checking of spectral data. Enabled by default.

Added argument to irradiance() to enable use of speed optimizations.

Defaults to arguments ensure that nothing changes from earlier versions unless new features are
explicitly enabled.

photobiology 0.2.0
==================

Reimplemented irradiance(), calc_mutlipliers, e2qmol_multipliers(), and added e2quantum_multipliers().
Also reimplemented new_waveband(), changing its interface. Some changes in other photobiologyxxxx will be needed.
