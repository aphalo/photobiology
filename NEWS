photobiology 0.2.2-0.2.3
========================

Revised photon_ratio() to use same optimizations.

Imporved implementation of cache. Now it is enclosed in an environment that is created when
the package is loaded and removed when it is unloaded.


photobiology 0.2.1
==================

Factored to a separate function the code to check spectral data, and added argument to irradiance to switch off the checking.

Added a "name" field to wavebands and a wb.name argument to new_waveband(), with a default so that no old code will be broken.

Added argument to calc_multipliers() to enable caching. Disabled by default.

Added argument to irradiance() to enable/disable checking of spectral data. Enabled by default.

Added argument to irradiance() to enable use of speed optimizations.

Defaults to arguments ensure that nothing changes from earlier versions unless new features are
explicitly enabled.

photobiology 0.2.0
==================

Reimplemented irradiance(), calc_mutlipliers, e2qmol_multipliers(), and added e2quantum_multipliers().
Also reimplemented new_waveband(), changing its interface. Some changes in other photobiologyxxxx will be needed.
