photobiology 0.2.16
===================
Changed irradiance() so that it optionally accepts a list of wave_bands and returns a vector or irradiances. The returned
values have a names attribute set to the names of the elements in the wave_band list. If the names are missing, it
returns the "name"s stored in the wave_band objects.

wave_band objects are now S3 objects with class "waveband", a print.waveband() function was added, which is called whenever
the generic print function is called on a "waveband" object.

photobiology 0.2.15
===================
Updated NAMESPACE to fix error caused by changes in Rcpp or R.

photobiology 0.2.14
===================
Updated User Guide. Modified interpolate_spectrum so that it uses cubic spline interpolation when the number
of data points is small, and linear interpolation otherwise.

photobiology 0.2.13
===================
Moved peaks-related functions to new package photobiologygg and removed dependence on splus2R.

photobiology 0.2.12
===================
Added new functions find_peaks and get_peaks, which are wrappers built on top of function peaks from package splus2R, which becomes a new dependency.

photobiology 0.2.11
===================
Added Rcpp version of insert_hinges() using the much faster binary search algorithm.

photobiology 0.2.10
===================
Small, backward compatible change to trim_tails: added fill parameter. If NULL (default) the function
works as earlier deleting the tails. If another value is passed as fill, the s.irrad values in the
tails are replaced with this value.

photobiology 0.2.9
==================
Added two new functions: interpolate_spectrum() and sum_spectra()

photobiology 0.2.7 + 0.2.8
==========================
The vignette "Examples" was moved to a sepate package because it used a very large data set.
An "benign"" error in new_waveband() was fixed (this has no effect on calculations).
The data set sun.data was updated to contain instantaneous data, and its documentation updated
to better describe the data.

photobiology 0.2.6
==================

A vignette "Examples" was added. Other examples will be added later on. No changes to R or C++ code.

photobiology 0.2.5
==================

A vignette "Manual" was added. No changes to R or C++ code.

photobiology 0.2.4
==================

As profiling showed that calls to insert_hinges() and within this function to which() were 
uisng most of run time of the functions, a new parameter was added to functions so that
the use of hinges can be switched on and off. The default is to use hinges for interpolation
only if the wavelength resolution of the spectrum is worse than 1.0 nm. This causes only
small errors in the results of calculations (< 1%) but reduces run time very significantly.
The defaults should work just fine in most cases, in which case there is no need to do any
changes to user code. In addition new_waveband() was modified so that if no SWF is used,
then hinges are not included in the waveband defined.

photobiology 0.2.2-0.2.3
========================

Revised photon_ratio() to use same optimizations.

Imporved implementation of cache. Now it is enclosed in an environment that is created when
the package is loaded and removed when it is unloaded.


photobiology 0.2.1
==================

Factored to a separate function the code to check spectral data, and added argument to irradiance to switch off the checking.

Added a "name" field to wavebands and a wb.name argument to new_waveband(), with a default so that no old code will be broken.

Added argument to calc_multipliers() to enable caching. Disabled by default.

Added argument to irradiance() to enable/disable checking of spectral data. Enabled by default.

Added argument to irradiance() to enable use of speed optimizations.

Defaults to arguments ensure that nothing changes from earlier versions unless new features are
explicitly enabled.

photobiology 0.2.0
==================

Reimplemented irradiance(), calc_mutlipliers, e2qmol_multipliers(), and added e2quantum_multipliers().
Also reimplemented new_waveband(), changing its interface. Some changes in other photobiologyxxxx will be needed.
